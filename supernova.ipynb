Look it up in this table: https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/flux_stds.html to find the apparent V band magnitude. Use this information to calculate the magnitude of the supernova, which is SN 2022hrs, a type Ia supernova in galaxy NGC 4647. Our observation was taken on the night of April 22/23, 2022. Our measurment will be a bit off because of the difference between the V filter and our G filter, but it should be close.
