# astropy
This repository uses binder to let you run astropy. Launch binder by clicking the link below. Unless you create a new notebook, you'll want to run files by launching a terminal from the launcher page.

The file calibrate.py shows an example of how to use CCDProc and astropy to process science frames using bias, dark and flat frames. Run this file by typing "python calibrate.py" in your terminal window. You'll need to upload your own files and modify the code to correspond to your data. This file makes use of the CCD Data Reduction Guide at https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html
