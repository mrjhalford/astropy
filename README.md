# astropy
This repository uses Binder to let you run astropy. Launch binder by clicking the link below.

The file calibrate.py shows an example of how to use CCDProc and astropy to process science frames using bias, dark and flat frames. You will need to upload your own files and modify the code to correspond to your data.
